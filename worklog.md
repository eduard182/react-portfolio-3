## Navbar - May 12th, 2015
Finished the Navbar component's first iteration and it's sub component the NavbarItem. Upon writing this though, I have to think that a subcomponent like NavbarItem isn't exactly reusable, which is what React Components tend go for. I think I did this because I wanted to make a small component from scratch. Maybe I'll refactor these together later.
